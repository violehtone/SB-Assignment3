# Assignment 3 - Free energy / Potential of mean force (PMF)
Assignment for the course Structural Bioinformatics
M.Sc. in Bioinformatics & Systems biology @ VU / UvA


### Introduction
In this practical you will calculate the free energy or, equivalently, the potential of mean force (PMF), associated with breaking the interaction between two proteins in a complex. This will be done by using the molecular dynamics technique combined with umbrella sampling.
