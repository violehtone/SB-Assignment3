Option     Filename  Type         Description
------------------------------------------------------------
  -f       conf.gro  Input        Structure file: gro g96 pdb tpr etc.
  -n 1VET-em_cg.ndx  Input, Opt!  Index file
  -o 1VET-em_B_posre_raw.itp  Output       Include file for topology
 -of     freeze.ndx  Output, Opt. Index file

Option       Type   Value   Description
------------------------------------------------------
-[no]h       bool   no      Print help info and quit
-[no]version bool   no      Print version info and quit
-nice        int    0       Set the nicelevel
-fc          vector 1000 1000 1000  Force constants (kJ/mol nm^2)
-freeze      real   0       If the -of option or this one is given an index
                            file will be written containing atom numbers of
                            all atoms that have a B-factor less than the
                            level given here
-[no]disre   bool   no      Generate a distance restraint matrix for all the
                            atoms in index
-disre_dist  real   0.1     Distance range around the actual distance for
                            generating distance restraints
-disre_frac  real   0       Fraction of distance to be used as interval
                            rather than a fixed distance. If the fraction of
                            the distance that you specify here is less than
                            the distance given in the previous option, that
                            one is used instead.
-disre_up2   real   1       Distance between upper bound for distance
                            restraints, and the distance at which the force
                            becomes constant (see manual)
-cutoff      real   -1      Only generate distance restraints for atoms pairs
                            within cutoff (nm)
-[no]constr  bool   no      Generate a constraint matrix rather than distance
                            restraints. Constraints of type 2 will be
                            generated that do generate exclusions.
