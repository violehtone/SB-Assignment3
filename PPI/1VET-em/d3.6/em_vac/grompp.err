NOTE 1 [file em.mdp]:
  nstcomm < nstcalcenergy defeats the purpose of nstcalcenergy, setting
  nstcomm to nstcalcenergy


NOTE 2 [file em.mdp]:
  The switch/shift interaction settings are just for compatibility; you
  will get better performance from applying potential modifiers to your
  interactions!



NOTE 3 [file em.mdp]:
  For energy conservation with switch/shift potentials, rlist should be 0.1
  to 0.3 nm larger than rcoulomb.


NOTE 4 [file em.mdp]:
  For energy conservation with switch/shift potentials, rlist should be 0.1
  to 0.3 nm larger than rvdw.
